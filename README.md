Author: Wendi Liu (wendi.liu@stfc.ac.uk) (derived from OpenFOAM MUI Patch by Stephen M. Longshaw)

Date: 24/12/2021 (Merry Christmas!)

Please Note:

1. The OpenFOAM-v2106 and ThirdParty-v2106 are patch and ready to use

2. Patch files "OpenFOAMv2106-MUIv1.2-gcc.tar.xz" are also provided, in case the user prefer to patch the official OF-v2106, but the OpenFOAM-v2106 and ThirdParty-v2106 in this repository do not need to patch again.

3. (Future work) This release has been tested with Ubuntu 20.04 and GCC 9.3.0. The General Rule need to change for other compilers.
